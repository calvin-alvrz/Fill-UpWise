# Application Name

Fill-UpWise

## Description

This C-based application helps you determine whether it's worth traveling to another location to fill up your car based on the difference in fuel prices.

## How it works

The program gathers information from the user by asking questions, calculations are made based on the answers provided and the outputs are:

+ Whether the travel is worth or not
+ Money saved for that outcome

The user needs to know how many litres fit in the car's tank and also the fuel consumption of the vehicle
