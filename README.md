# Fill-UpWise

## Description

This C-based application assists users in determining whether it's worth travelling to another location to fill up their car based on the difference in fuel prices. It aims to help users save money by making informed decisions about refuelling their vehicles.

## How it works

The program gathers information from the user by asking questions, calculations are made based on the answers provided and the outputs are:

+ Whether the travel is worth it or not
+ Money saved for that outcome

The user needs to know how many litres fit in the car's tank and also the fuel consumption of the vehicle
